# AeroZoom – Keyboard-Free Screen-Magnifying Presentation Tool and Mouse-Enhancing Panel for Windows

Scripted in AutoHotkey, AeroZoom enhances upon Windows Magnifier and optionally Sysinternals ZoomIt to enable screen magnification like macOS with mouse-wheeling and pinch-to-zoom, as well as turning any mouse into a Home-Theater PC/presentation mouse, where zooming and positioning become a breeze without a keyboard.

For download of the latest version (portable application & per-user/all-users installer), please visit its homepage:

- [Download AeroZoom](https://tech.wandersick.com/p/aerozoom-for-windows-7-magnifier.html#download)

After downloading and extracting AeroZoom.zip, AeroZoom.exe portable application can be used immediately. Alternatively, Setup.exe (optional) provides installation into Current User or All Users location. For enterprise deployment, a silent installer is also available on request ([email the developer](https://tech.wandersick.com/p/about.html#contact)).

## Become a Beta Tester for AeroZoom 5.0

See a list of upcoming AeroZoom 5.0 features [here](https://github.com/wandersick/aerozoom-doc/blob/master/AeroZoom_5.0_Features.md).

If you are interested in being a beta tester, email <a href="mailto:wandersick@gmail.com">wandersick@gmail.com</a>. Thank you!

## Main Features

1. Enables full-screen zooming via mouse wheel or pinch-to-zoom in Windows (like OS X) with multiple zoom modes: Reverse Zoom, Elastic Zoom, etc.
2. Zoom in/out or reset any time without a keyboard; handle more operations with one hand
3. Binding keyboard controls commonly used in a presentation to mouse buttons and buttons on the AeroZoom Panel

(The above is customizable in program settings)

## Use Cases

- Presentation / teaching / screencast / Zoom meetings & webinars (or Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx, etc.)
- For the elderly / people with visual disabilities
- Gaming
- Home-Theater PC (HTPC)
- For some, it is essential – use it for everything

## Getting Started

Run AeroZoom.exe, and try:

1. Zoom with [Left]+[Wheel-up/down] mouse buttons [(**quick demo**)](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7849/46340700265_33a567d956_o.gif)
2. Reset zoom with [Left]+[Middle] buttons [(**quick demo**)](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7873/47255244051_18ca51de55_o.gif)
3. Bring up the AeroZoom panel by pressing [Left]+[Right], where more functions can be accessed [(**quick demo**)](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7880/47203430182_17c98b2bee_o.gif)

## Key Bindings

AeroZoom binds common keyboard controls primarily to these mouse buttons:

| **Function** | **Mouse** | **Keyboard** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AeroZoom panel | [Left] &amp; [Right] |   |
| Show magnifier | [Left] &amp; [Wheel-up] | [WinKey] &amp; [+] |
| Reset zoom | [Left] &amp; [Middle] |   |
| Zoom in ![](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4527751470_4a28fa78d6_o.jpg "Zoom in") | [Left] &amp; [Wheel-up] | [WinKey] &amp; [+] |
| Zoom out  ![](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4527751474_93f73566b9_o.jpg "Zoom out") | [Left] &amp; [Wheel-down] | [WinKey] &amp; [-] |

... where **[Left]** can mostly be substituted simply by clicking any other modifier, such as **[Ctrl]**, on the AeroZoom Panel:

![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-05uPDrjnQUY/YNiKZT5BWoI/AAAAAAAACzs/pr9bRpTToYAdFvS8UdBoJRzCm9xQiaLMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/5583194454_3a71e20ed9_o.png "AeroZoom Panel and menus (from a previous version, 2.0, which does not include some new features)")

**Figure 1**.  AeroZoom Panel and menus (from a previous version, 2.0, which does not include some new features)

## Getting Started (continued)

And if you would like to try out some more features:

4. Switch the default [Left] mouse button modifier to a key e.g. [Ctrl] as shown on the bottom left of the above picture of AeroZoom panel, then try zooming by pressing [Ctrl]+[Wheel-up/down]
5. Try holding the middle mouse button to trigger drawing on screen, but first you would have to customize an action triggered on holding the middle mouse button at 'Tool > Custom Hotkeys > Settings > Holding Middle', i.e. 'ZoomIt: Draw' (or other functions e.g. taking a screenshot and auto-save it)
6. Finding the zoom rate a bit too much or too little per press of zooming hotkey? Instead of going into sub-settings of Windows Magnifier, simply adjust the granularity (6 levels) on AeroZoom panel by dragging the Zoom Rate Slider (at the top right corner in the above picture)

## Word of Mouth

In the last decade, AeroZoom has been recommended by users including Microsoft MVP, the media and it has been downloaded at least over tens of thousands of times across the world. Thanks for the love! ❤️️ 

Below are some of the kind comments left by AeroZoom users:

- "[The presentation went well and I could zoom in to the menus and graphs to help the eyes of the people coming listening. It was very good.](https://www.instagram.com/p/-wJi_WDt4m/)"
- "I'm used to the zoom on Mac so I was looking to reproduce this on Windows and your tool is the closest I've found."
- "Great for zooming TV screen while sitting in the sofa, much quicker and easier than the usual Windows magnifier. Exactly what I was looking for."
- "I use it everyday so it only seems fair to [donate](https://tech.wandersick.com/p/donate.html) to you. The tool helps me so much in my day to day."
- "For my poor eyes it is really a great help. Thank you very much."
- "[The must have tool for developers and other IT-guys doing presentations.](https://twitter.com/willem_meints/status/60754897573912576)"

## Usage and Tips

1. If a user suddenly wants to modify a setting in Windows Magnifier, such as making it follow keyboard inputs automatically. Instead of finding the Magnifier window that may be hidden deep in the taskbar, simply launch the AeroZoom panel by mouse buttons, [Left]+[Right], and click on the big &#39;Keyboard&#39; button on the panel to toggle the setting.

2. If a user has messed up any settings, for example, the screen color is inverted, and magnification is locked while zoomed in, the user wants to correct it but sadly Magnifier is minimized and out of sight. What the user can do is to launch the AeroZoom panel quickly by mouse buttons [Left]+[Right] which always follows cursor so that he/she can fix the settings there.
    - When in emergency, click the &#39;Kill&#39; button there to shut down Magnifier or &#39;Reset&#39; button to restore default settings and zoom level.
    - Even more quickly, click [Left]+[Middle] to reset zoom immediately even without the panel, although it doesn&#39;t restore other settings.
    - &#39;Mag&#39; (previously &#39;Show&#39;) button on the AeroZoom panel can also be used to restore a Magnifier window minimized in the taskbar as well as starting it.
      - The fastest way however to start Magnifier is just to wheel up.

3. If drawing on screen is desired, click [Draw] which launches Snipping Tool Windows where users can take a picture of the screen and draw on it. Similarly, click [Type] to launch Wordpad (where pictures from Snipping Tool can be pasted too); click [Calc] to launch Calculator.

4. There are times AeroZoom&#39;s mouse button mapping might cause inconvenience with some applications. To solve this, there&#39;s no need to exit AeroZoom; just click the [off] button on the lower left corner of the panel to temporarily pause the mapping. To resume, click it again.
    - To minimize AeroZoom to tray, simply close it or click [hide] button on the panel; to exit, click [quit]

5. Besides presentations, another usage is capturing screen videos for tutorial purpose. Where normally it would take a lot of work learning and using professional video editors such as Adobe Premiere to zoom in, with AeroZoom, however, simply zoom in with the magnifier hidden during recording and it&#39;s done. No post-production required. <br><br>

**Figure 2.**  Accessing Windows Magnifier functions from AeroZoom panel

**More features of AeroZoom are introduced below**  – AeroZoom Panel, ZoomIt Panel, Elastic Zoom, AeroSnip (beta), etc.

---

### **AeroZoom Panel – Mini Panel for Commanding AeroZoom**

- Accessible conveniently by clicking [Left]+[Right] anywhere on screen (Upon calling by mouse buttons, it pops up where the cursor is, without the need to locate the Magnifier window minimized in taskbar)
- Made of large buttons designed to quickly toggle sub-magnifier settings (e.g. screen color inversion) or to add more functions (e.g. resetting magnification)
- [Mag] (previously [Show]), [Kill] and [Reset] buttons restore a hidden Magnifier, stop the magnifier process and apply default settings; [Draw], [Type], [Calc], [Paint] buttons run Snipping Tool, WordPad, Calculator and Paint (optional) respectively

### **ZoomIt Panel – Enhances Sysinternals ZoomIt**

Switching from Windows Magnifier Panel to ZoomIt Panel improves mouse operation of Sysinternals ZoomIt by adding a panel-style user interface, elastic zoom, wheel-zoom/pinch-zoom and more. Start by pressing the small button named &#39;zoom&#39; on the AeroZoom Panel which enables the switch between AeroZoom Panel and ZoomIt Panel.

- Wheel-zoom/pinch-zoom support for Sysinternals ZoomIt (selectable between Live Zoom or Still Zoom) as well as other zoom modes such as Elastic Zoom
- Mouse-friendly graphical user interface for accessing functions that would have required keyboard shortcuts, utilizing functions such as the pen-color slider, white/black board
- Customize mouse hotkeys to achieve keyboard-less presentation (a handy list of ZoomIt keyboard shortcuts at hand)

### **Elastic Zoom – Automatically Zoom in and out by Holding and Releasing the Same Hotkey**

- Elastic Zoom allows zooming in and out just by holding and releasing the same hotkey [Ctrl]+[Caps Lock], simplifying screen magnification.

### **AeroSnip (beta) – Enhances Snipping Tool**

Whereas AeroZoom improves Windows Magnifier, a sub-feature of AeroZoom, AeroSnip (beta), enhances upon the Snipping Tool, giving an integrated screen-capturing experience, all within AeroZoom Panel.

- Switch to AeroSnip Slider on AeroZoom Panel that quickly switches between free-form, rectangular, window and full-screen snips
- Each snipping mode (free, rectangular, window, full screen) has their own hotkeys: Win+Alt+F, Win+Alt+R, Win+Alt+W, Win+Alt+S
- After snipping or pressing Print Screen, open the image with an external editor such as Paint, other than Snipping Tool&#39;s editor
- Automatically save Snipping Tool and Print Screen captures in any location (default: desktop) as well as clipboard
- Press and hold Middle button for half a second to start a snip of the type currently selected on the AeroSnip Slider. (Button, delay and the action can be customized. See &#39;Custom Hotkeys&#39;)
- Streamlined procedures to start a new snip – just use hotkeys or the Snip button anytime a new snip is wanted

### **Other Features**

- Custom Hotkeys – 30+ customizible mouse-utilizing hotkeys and functions
- Reverse zooming, an implementation for users accustomed to &quot;natural scrolling&quot; on Apple Mac OS X
- Quickly switch between multiple setting profiles: Home, School, Work, On-the-Go, Presentation, Gaming
- Configuration import and export (automatic backup on exit)
- Lots of useful Windows tools accessible from AeroZoom Panel
  - Shut down/reboot/sleep/lock PC via Panel (Tool > Windows Tools) helping Windows 8 users without a start button

- Single-clicking the tray icon or the &#39;off&#39; button on Panel turns off/on AeroZoom temporarily in an easy way
- Center Zoom (experimental)
- Both installable and portable (scripted in AutoHotkey)
- And more!

## Workarounds to Known Issues

The below issues have been identified and will be fixed in the upcoming AeroZoom 5.0. For now, please refer to the below workarounds:

- AeroZoom `Setup.exe` does not uninstall itself cleanly, leaving `Setup.exe` and `AeroZoom_*x64.exe` files in the installation directory
  - **Workaround**: They can be manually removed if desired
- `zoomit.exe` cannot be downloaded by AeroZoom as the included `wget.exe` utility is out of date
  - **Workaround**: Simply download [zoomit.exe](https://live.sysinternals.com/zoomit.exe) manually

## False-Positive Anti-virus Detection on Unattended Installer

This section is for users who use the [unattended installer](https://tech.wandersick.com/2019/07/how-to-create-silent-installer-with.html) downloaded [here](https://github.com/wandersick/aerozoom/releases) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/aerozoom) installation option.

Like certain AutoHotkey applications, [some anti-virus vendors may falsely identify the unattended installer created as undesirable](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/015da23376e29da9e7501eaaf9c501fbfd3fce87e5604cd09fbe4cd191537c27/detection). It is understandable considering the nature of the unattended installer is to perform installation and uninstallation in a silent way, which involves seemingly risky tasks such as modifying uninstallation keys in the registry. **This false-positive detection issue can be safely ignored**. It is recommended to [report the file to your anti-virus vendor as clean if possible](https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-report-malware-or-false-positives-multiple-antivirus-vendors.htm).
